    Dr Semmelweis Analysis: Dr Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who worked in the Vienna General Hospital. In the past people thought of illness as caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and started making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever. In this analysis, we put ourselves in Dr Semmelweis shoes and analysis some of his data published in 1861 in order to discover why so many women died of childbed fever.

   Multivariable and Linear Regression: Here we analyze dataset from [UCI ML housing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. You can find the [original research paper here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/22636/0000186.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). At the end of this project, we are able to train a solid model in predicting house prices using sklearn library.

    Nobel Prize Analysis: Alfred Nobel was a wealthy man and after his death he had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. Alfred Nobel believed that his wealth should be ‚Äúgiven to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind‚Äù. Thus, every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. For this project, we want to know what patterns we can find in the data of the past Nobel laureates and what can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally?

    Seaborn Linear Regression: In this project we analyzed a dataset which was scraped from [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets) on **May 1st, 2018**. This dataset showcase information about the box office movie data which include movie production cost, gross revenue, movie titles and so on. We used sklearn library in order to train a linear regression model in order to study the relationship between movie production cost and gross revenue.
